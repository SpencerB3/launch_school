# Question 7

One day Spot was playing with the Munster family's home computer and he wrote a small program to mess with their demographic data:

```Ruby
munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

def mess_with_demographics(demo_hash)

  demo_hash.values.each do |family_member|
    family_member["age"] += 42
    family_member["gender"] = "other"
  end
end
```

After writing this method, he typed the following...and before Grandpa could stop him, he hit the Enter key with his tail:

`mess_with_demographics(munsters)`

Did the family's data get ransacked? Why or why not?

Yes.  The argument is never reassigned in the method, so all the items within the hash are altered, though the `object_id` for the `munsters` hash remains the same.
