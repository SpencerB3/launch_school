# Question 8

Method calls can take expressions as arguments. Suppose we define a method called rps as follows, which follows the classic rules of rock-paper-scissors game, but with a slight twist that it declares whatever hand was used in the tie as the result of that tie.

```Ruby
def rps(fist1, fist2)
  if fist1 == "rock"
    (fist2 == "paper") ? "paper" : "rock"
  elsif fist1 == "paper"
    (fist2 == "scissors") ? "scissors" : "paper"
  else
    (fist2 == "rock") ? "rock" : "scissors"
  end
end
```

What is the result of the following call?

`puts rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")), "rock")`

Answer:
`paper` - the results of the two innermost expressions (`paper` against `rock`) result in `paper`, and then `paper` get evaluated against `rock` which finally returns `paper`
