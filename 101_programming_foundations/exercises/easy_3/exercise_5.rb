# Using the multiply method from the "Multiplying Two Numbers" problem, write a method that computes the square of its argument (the square is the result of multiplying a number by itself).

def multiply(num1, num2)

end

def square(num)
  multiply(num, num)
end

puts square(5) == 25
square(-8) == 64
