# Question 3

Alan wrote the following method, which was intended to show all of the factors of the input number:

```Ruby
def factors(number)
  divisor = number
  factors = []
  begin
    factors << number / divisor if number % divisor == 0
    divisor -= 1
  end until divisor == 0
  factors
end
```

Alyssa noticed that this will fail if the input is `0`, or a negative number, and asked Alan to change the loop. How can you make this work without using `begin/end/until`? Note that we're not looking to find the factors for `0` or negative numbers, but we just want to handle it gracefully instead of raising an exception or going into an infinite loop.

-Answer-

```Ruby
def factors(number)
  divisor = number
  factors = []
  while divisor > 0
    factors << number / divisor if number % divisor == 0
    divisor -= 1
  end 
  factors
end
```

# Bonus 1
What is the purpose of the `number % divisor == 0` ?

  Verifies if the `number` has no remainder when divided by `divisor`.

# Bonus 2
What is the purpose of the second-to-last line (line 8) in the method (the factors before the method's end)?

  The purpose of the second-to-last line is make sure the method returns `factors` when it is called.
