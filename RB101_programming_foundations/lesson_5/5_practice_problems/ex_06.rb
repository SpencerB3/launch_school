# One of the most frequently used real-world string properties is that of "string substitution", where we take a hard-coded string and modify it with various parameters from our program.

# Given this previously seen family hash, print out the name, age and gender of each family member:

# ...like this:

# (Name) is a (age)-year-old (male or female).
