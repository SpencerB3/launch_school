# In the previous practice problem we added Dino to our array like this:

flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
# flintstones << "Dino"

# We could have used either Array#concat or Array#push to add Dino to the family.

# How can we add multiple items to our array? (Dino and Hoppy)

flintstones.concat(['Dino']) # => we can only use the concat method if the string object 'Dino' is in an array

flintstones.push('Dino', 'Hoppy')
