# In the code below, an array containing the numbers 1 through 5 is assigned to numbers.

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Use Array#map to iterate over numbers and return a new array with each number doubled. Assign the returned array to a variable named doubled_numbers and print its value using #p.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

doubled_numbers = numbers.map { |num| num * 2 }
