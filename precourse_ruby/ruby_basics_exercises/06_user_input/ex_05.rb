# Write a program that prints 'Launch School is the best!' repeatedly until a certain number of lines have been printed. The program should obtain the number of lines from the user, and should insist that at least 3 lines are printed.

# For now, just use #to_i to convert the input value to an Integer, and check that result instead of trying to insist on a valid number; validation of numeric input is a topic with a fair number of edge conditions that are beyond the scope of this exercise.

lines = nil

loop do
  puts '>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:'
  lines = gets.chomp.to_i
  
  break if lines >= 3
  puts ">> That's not enough lines"
end

lines.times { puts 'Launch School is the best!' }
