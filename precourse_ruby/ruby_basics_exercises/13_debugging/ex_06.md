You want to have a small script delivering motivational quotes, but with the following code you run into a very common error message: `no implicit conversion of nil into String (TypeError)`. What is the problem and how can you fix it?

```ruby
def get_quote(person)
  if person == 'Yoda'
    'Do. Or do not. There is no try.'
  end

  if person == 'Confucius'
    'I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.'
  end

  if person == 'Einstein'
    'Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.'
  end
end

puts 'Confucius says:'
puts '"' + get_quote('Confucius') + '"'
```

  The problem above is that the `get_quote` method above always return the result of the last `if` statement. Therefore, `get_quote`, when not given the string `Einstein`, as an argument will always raise the same error message.  In order to allow the other options to be read, we need to use only one `if` statement.

```ruby
def get_quote(person)
  if person == 'Yoda'
    'Do. Or do not. There is no try.'
  elsif person == 'Confucius'
    'I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.'
  elsif person == 'Einstein'
    'Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still 				 greater.'
  end
end

puts 'Confucius says:'
puts '"' + get_quote('Confucius') + '"'
```
