# Write a method that takes an Array of Integers between 0 and 19, and returns an Array of those Integers sorted based on the English words for each number:

NUMBER_WORDS = %w(zero one two three four
                  five six seven eight nine
                  ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
                  fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen)

def alphabetic_number_sort(array)
  new_array = array.map { |num| NUMBER_WORDS[num] }.sort
  p new_array.map { |num| NUMBER_WORDS.index(num) }
end

alphabetic_number_sort((0..19).to_a) == [
  8, 18, 11, 15, 5, 4, 14, 9, 19, 1, 7, 17,
  6, 16, 10, 13, 3, 12, 2, 0
]
