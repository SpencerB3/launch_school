# Write another method that returns true if the string passed as an argument is a palindrome, false otherwise. This time, however, your method should be case-insensitive, and it should ignore all non-alphanumeric characters. If you wish, you may simplify things by calling the palindrome? method you wrote in the previous exercise.

def real_palindrome?(string)
  string = string.downcase.delete('^a-z0-9')
  string == string.reverse
end

real_palindrome?('madam') == true
real_palindrome?('Madam') == true           # (case does not matter)
real_palindrome?("Madam, I'm Adam") == true # (only alphanumerics matter)
real_palindrome?('356653') == true
real_palindrome?('356a653') == true
real_palindrome?('123ab321') == false
