# Write a method that takes a floating point number that represents an angle between 0 and 360 degrees and returns a String that represents that angle in degrees, minutes and seconds. You should use a degree symbol (°) to represent degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds. A degree has 60 minutes, while a minute has 60 seconds.

DEGREE = "\xC2\xB0"
MINUTES_PER_DEGREE = 60
SECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60
SECONDS_PER_DEGREE = SECONDS_PER_MINUTE * MINUTES_PER_DEGREE

def dms(degrees_float)
  total_seconds = (degrees_float * SECONDS_PER_DEGREE).round
  degrees, remaining_seconds = total_seconds.divmod(SECONDS_PER_DEGREE)
  minutes, seconds = remaining_seconds.divmod(SECONDS_PER_MINUTE)
  degrees %= 360
  puts format(%(#{degrees}#{DEGREE}'%02d,"%02d), minutes, seconds)
end

dms(30) == %(30°00'00")
dms(76.73) == %(76°43'48")
dms(254.6) == %(254°36'00")
dms(93.034773) == %(93°02'05")
dms(0) == %(0°00'00")
dms(360) == %(360°00'00") || dms(360) == %(0°00'00")
