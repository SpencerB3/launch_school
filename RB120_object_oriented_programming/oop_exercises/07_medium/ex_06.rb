# Create an object-oriented number guessing class for numbers in the range 1 to 100, with a limit of 7 guesses per game. The game should play like this:

# hit play, generate random numberrbetween  1 to 100
# player starts with  7  guesses
# Enter a number 
  # either invalid, too  low, too high, or correct number
# refresh how many gueeses are left
# no more guesses, game ends
