# Now that we have a Walkable module, we are given a new challenge. Apparently some of our users are nobility, and the regular way of walking simply isn't good enough. Nobility need to strut.

# We need a new class Noble that shows the title and name when walk is called:

module Walkable
  def walk
    "#{self} #{gait} forward."
  end
end

class Person
  attr_reader :name

  include Walkable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def to_s
    name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "strolls"
  end
end

class Cat
  attr_reader :name

  include Walkable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def to_s
    name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "saunters"
  end
end

class Cheetah
  attr_reader :name

  include Walkable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def to_s
    name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "runs"
  end
end

class Noble
  attr_reader :name, :title

  include Walkable

  def initialize(name, title)
    @name = name
    @title = title
  end

  def to_s
    "#{@title} #{@name}"
  end

  private

  def gait
    'struts'
  end
end

byron = Noble.new("Byron", "Lord")
p byron.walk
# => "Lord Byron struts forward"
