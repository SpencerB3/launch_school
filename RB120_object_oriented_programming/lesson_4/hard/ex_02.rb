# Ben and Alyssa are working on a vehicle management system. So far, they have created classes called Auto and Motorcycle to represent automobiles and motorcycles. After having noticed common information and calculations they were performing for each type of vehicle, they decided to break out the commonality into a separate class called WheeledVehicle. This is what their code looks like so far:

module Moveable
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_writer :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency
  
  def range
    @fuel_capacity * @fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class WheeledVehicle
  include Moveable
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading

  def initialize(tire_array, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @tires = tire_array
    self.fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    self.fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end

end

class Auto < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 4 tires are various tire pressures
    super([30,30,32,32], 50, 25.0)
  end
end

class Motorcycle < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 2 tires are various tire pressures
    super([20,20], 80, 8.0)
  end
end

# Now Alan has asked them to incorporate a new type of vehicle into their system - a Catamaran defined as follows:

class Catamaran
  include Moveable

  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @propeller_count = num_propellers
    @hull_count = num_hulls
    self.km_traveled_per_liter = km_traveled_per_liter
    self.liters_of_fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end
end

# This new class does not fit well with the object hierarchy defined so far. Catamarans don't have tires. But we still want common code to track fuel efficiency and range. Modify the class definitions and move code into a Module, as necessary, to share code among the Catamaran and the wheeled vehicles.
