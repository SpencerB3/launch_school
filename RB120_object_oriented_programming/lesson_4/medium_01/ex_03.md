In the last question Alan showed Alyssa this code which keeps track of items for a shopping cart application:

```ruby
class InvoiceEntry
  attr_reader :quantity, :product_name

  def initialize(product_name, number_purchased)
    @quantity = number_purchased
    @product_name = product_name
  end

  def update_quantity(updated_count)
    quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
  end
end
```

Alyssa noticed that this will fail when `update_quantity` is called. Since quantity is an instance variable, it must be accessed with the `@quantity` notation when setting it. One way to fix this is to change `attr_reader` to `attr_accessor` and change `quantity` to `self.quantity`.

Is there anything wrong with fixing it this way?

Answer: this code will run without raising an error but the public interfaces have changed.  The instance variable `@quantity` can now be reset directly by anyone who calls `<instance.quality = value>` notation rahter than through the `update_quantity` method.
