# One problem is that we need to keep track of different breeds of dogs, since they have slightly different behaviors. For example, bulldogs can't swim, but all other dogs can.

# Create a sub-class from Dog called Bulldog overriding the swim method to return "can't swim!"

class Dog
  def speak
    'bark!'
  end

  def swim
    'swimming!'
  end
end

class Bulldog < Dog
  def swim
    "can't swim!"
  end
end

teddy = Dog.new
puts teddy.speak           # => "bark!"
puts teddy.swim           # => "swimming!"

lucy = Bulldog.new

puts lucy.speak
puts lucy.swim
