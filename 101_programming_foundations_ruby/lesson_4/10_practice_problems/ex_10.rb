# Modify the hash such that each member of the Munster family has an additional "age_group" key that has one of three values describing the age group the family member is in (kid, adult, or senior). Your solution should produce the hash below

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

munsters.each do |name, details|
  case details['age']
  when (0..16)
    details['age_group'] = 'kids'
  when (17..64)
    details['age_group'] = 'adult'
  else
    details['age_group'] = 'senior'
  end
end
