#### Question 4

Alyssa was asked to write an implementation of a rolling buffer. You can add and remove elements from a rolling buffer. However, once the buffer becomes full, any new elements will displace the oldest elements in the buffer.

She wrote two implementations of the code for adding elements to the buffer. In presenting the code to her team leader, she said "Take your pick. Do you prefer `push()` or `concat()` for modifying the buffer?".

Is there a difference between these implementations, other than the method she used to add an element to the buffer?

```javascript
function addToRollingBuffer1(buffer, maxBufferSize, newElement) {
  buffer.push(newElement);
  if (buffer.length > maxBufferSize) {
    buffer.shift();
  }
  return buffer;
}

function addToRollingBuffer2(buffer, maxBufferSize, newElement) {
  buffer = buffer.concat(newElement);
  if (buffer.length > maxBufferSize) {
    buffer.shift();
  }
  return buffer;
}
```



There is a difference between the two functions above.  They both give the same return value, but the first function mutates the parameter `buffer` while the second function does not mutate the parameter `buffer`.
