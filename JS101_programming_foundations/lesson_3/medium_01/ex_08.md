#### Question 8

One day, Spot was playing with the Munster family's home computer, and he wrote a small program to mess with their demographic data:

```javascript
let munsters = {
  Herman: { age: 32, gender: "male" },
  Lily: { age: 30, gender: "female" },
  Grandpa: { age: 402, gender: "male" },
  Eddie: { age: 10, gender: "male" },
  Marilyn: { age: 23, gender: "female" }
};

function messWithDemographics(demoObject) {
  Object.values(demoObject).forEach(familyMember => {
    familyMember["age"] += 42;
    familyMember["gender"] = "other";
  });
}
```

After writing this function, he typed the following code:

```javascript
messWithDemographics(munsters);
```

Before Grandpa could stop him, Spot hit the Enter key with his tail. Did the family's data get ransacked? Why or why not?



Yes, the family's data has been mutated.  Since objects are passed by reference in JavaScript, the object that the function `messWithDemographics` mutates is whichever argument is passed in.
